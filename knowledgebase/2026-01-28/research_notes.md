------------------------------------------------------------

Summary 2:
This project, titled "Show HN: A MitM proxy to see what your LLM tools are sending," presents a tool designed to intercept and inspect communications between LLM (Large Language Model) tools and their underlying data sources or APIs. It essentially functions as a man-in-the-middle (MitM) proxy, enabling users to observe, debug, and potentially verify the data being transmitted by various LLM applications. A noted error in accessing the tool was "name 'session' is not defined," suggesting that there may be an unresolved issue or bug related to session management in the current codebase.

Technically, the project leverages proxy techniques to capture HTTP communications, thereby allowing developers or researchers to gain insights into the operations of LLM-based systems. This can be particularly significant for understanding the behavior, performance, or potential vulnerabilities of these AI tools. Interested users can explore the project further on its GitHub repository at https://github.com/jmuncor/sherlock.
