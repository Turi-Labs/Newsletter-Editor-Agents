This post introduces a new startup effort from Charlie Labs, showcasing their agent “Charlie” designed for TypeScript teams through an experimental, head-to-head evaluation of their integration with a light GPT-5 model against Claude Code. In the comparison, GPT-5 demonstrated superior performance on 10 real-world TypeScript issues, outpacing Claude Code on every case. The evaluation was based on three key criteria—testability, description, and overall quality—where GPT-5 notably resolved 29% more issues and achieved a 5% higher quality in pull request (PR) reviews. For example, while Charlie’s generated code scored better in testability (0.69 vs. 0.55) and overall quality (0.84 vs. 0.65), Claude Code had a slight advantage in description (0.90 vs. 0.84).  

The results, while preliminary and derived from single-shot runs without a human feedback loop, suggest that GPT-5’s approach within Charlie Labs’ framework is well-suited to enhance TypeScript development by effectively generating technically sound and actionable code changes. The study, which uses a secondary LLM reviewer for transparent quality assessment, opens a broader discussion on the potential and future development of AI-assisted programming tools.
