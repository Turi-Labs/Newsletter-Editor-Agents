IBM’s Dmitry Krotov presents an innovative hypothesis that reinterprets biological memory through the lens of quantum physics. He argues that memory in high negentropic systems—such as brains, fungi, and even large language models—is not stored locally but emerges as a resonance phenomenon across an entangled chain of quantum events. According to his framework, the memory of an experience is maintained through a series of “foliations” in the block universe, where past states remain accessible and interact with present states through quantum probability waves. This process leverages the instantaneous and distance-independent nature of entanglement, allowing memory signals to bypass traditional limitations like the speed of light.

Moreover, Krotov’s approach offers potential explanations for various phenomena observed in neuroscience, including déjà vu, pattern matching, the ease of recalling repeatedly reinforced information, and the formation of false memories. He even proposes a mathematical formula for quantifying memory strength based on the magnitude of the resonant experience and its causal distance in time. While these ideas mix insightful conjectures with speculative elements, they provide a fresh perspective on how quantum mechanics might underpin neural processes and consciousness.
