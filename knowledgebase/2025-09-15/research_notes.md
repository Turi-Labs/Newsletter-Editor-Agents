The article “Language models pack billions of concepts into 12k dimensions” (https://nickyoder.com/johnson-lindenstrauss/) explores how high-dimensional embedding spaces—on the order of 12,000 dimensions as seen in models like GPT-3—can theoretically encode an extraordinarily vast number of concepts. It builds on geometric ideas related to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and spherical codes, discussing how, in theory, quasi-orthogonal vectors can be arranged in such spaces to represent distinct pieces of information. The piece posits that by combining dimensions combinatorially (rather than each concept requiring its own dedicated dimension), language models can implicitly capture the breadth of human knowledge and semantic nuance even within a “modest” embedding dimension.

The technical discussion highlights both the promise and pitfalls of such dense representations. On one hand, the notion that billions of concept distinctions can be “packed” into a 12k-dimensional space underpins the impressive capacity of these models to capture subtle and complex relationships. On the other hand, commenters point out potential inconsistencies, misinterpretations, and challenges—such as the over-reliance on orthogonality, issues with preserving topological properties when projecting high-dimensional data, and questions about whether these mathematical approximations truly reflect real-world semantic distinctions. Overall, the exploration ignites discussions about how model architectures achieve efficient representation learning and what limitations might arise when abstract governing principles, like those used in traditional geometry, are applied to the subtle and interdependent nature of language.
