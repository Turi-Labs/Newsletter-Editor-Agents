The central point of the discussion is that LLM inference appears to be very inexpensive compared to other API services—such as traditional web search—even when accounting for the underlying hardware, energy, and operational costs. Many commentators note that while the training costs for these models are high and require continuous investment to maintain state‐of‐the‐art performance, the marginal cost of running inference per token is low. Technical details cited include the differences between capital expenditures (capex) like buying GPUs versus operational expenditures (opex) such as power consumption, alongside empirical estimates suggesting that optimized inference on modern GPUs can cost as little as fractions of a cent per million tokens.

This cost efficiency has important implications for the market: it may justify aggressive loss-leader pricing strategies to rapidly capture market share, similar to early internet services, and might eventually support models driven by ads or additional monetization streams instead of high subscription fees. However, the sustainability of such low pricing is a matter of debate given the ongoing need for model updates, hardware investments, and the inherent challenges in balancing free and paid usage.
