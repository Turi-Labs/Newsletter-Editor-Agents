Larry Ellison’s proposal, as discussed in the Fortune article (https://fortune.com/2025/02/14/larry-ellison-ai-centralized-database-citizen-data/), calls for a centralized national data repository that would consolidate all U.S. national—and notably, personal—data to be processed by artificial intelligence. This concept is presented as a means to leverage AI for enhanced oversight, fraud prevention, and a more integrated analysis of government and corporate data. Proponents see the move as a way to transform public administration and regulatory enforcement, potentially ushering in more efficient automation and data-driven decision-making.

The discussion around Ellison’s idea is highly polarized. Key technical and policy debates include concerns over privacy, the actual capabilities of current AI systems (with some commenters arguing that modern AI is essentially probabilistic and not infallible), and the potential for government overreach. Skeptics warn that while a consolidated data system might improve fraud detection or regulatory oversight, it also raises significant ethical and practical challenges—ranging from data governance and security to the risk of misinterpretation or abuse of power, akin to scenarios reminiscent of dystopian narratives.
