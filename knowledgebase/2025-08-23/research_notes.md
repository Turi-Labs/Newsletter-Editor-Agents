Google’s recent announcement claims that it has reduced the energy cost per AI query by 33x over the past year, a measure detailed in both a technical research paper and a Google Cloud blog post. The effort is driven by a mix of software and hardware efficiencies—including model improvements through quantization, the use of MoE techniques, and faster machine utilization—that contribute to lower per-prompt energy usage. The report focuses on the “median Gemini Apps text prompt” metric, though some critics argue that relying on the median may obscure higher energy costs experienced by less efficient, more computationally intensive models.

This development has significant implications for balancing AI performance with environmental sustainability, yet also raises questions about whether cost reductions are truly reflective of overall energy savings when accounting for increased query volumes. Critics express concern that the promotional figures might be selectively reported, potentially conflating energy usage across different AI products and operational contexts.
