Summary 1:
A recent study highlighted in the Gizmodo article reveals that AI image generators consistently default to 12 specific photo styles. This research found that platforms designed for generating images, regardless of the underlying technology, tend to prioritize these preset stylistic frameworks—likely due to the nature of their training data and algorithmic design. In essence, the systems are fine-tuned to produce a limited range of visual outputs, which suggests a convergence in how these technologies interpret and render images.

The significance of this finding is multifaceted. On one hand, the reliance on a narrow set of styles could limit creative expression and lead to a homogenization of visual content in automated image generation. On the other hand, it raises important questions about the diversity and representativeness of the training datasets used to develop these models. This study points to the potential need for developing more varied and inclusive training approaches to broaden the visual repertoire of AI generators.
