Gemini Embedding, as detailed on Google’s blog, introduces a novel approach to powering retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and context engineering by leveraging advanced embedding models. The Gemini embedding model, gemini-embedding-001, uses Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to produce high-dimensional vectors (typically 768, 1536, or 3072 dimensions) where the initial segments of the embedding provide simpler, yet effective, representations of the original data. While embeddings efficiently enable semantic search—by chunking documents and using cosine similarity for ranking—the discussion clarifies that embeddings themselves are not directly placed into an LLM’s working memory. Instead, the retrieved and processed source texts are integrated into the context window to inform large language model outputs.

The conversation also delves into the broader technical landscape where practitioners compare RAG techniques with tool-assisted search methods. Participants highlight that while embeddings can enhance retrieval and reduce storage overhead through truncation, the ultimate process still involves locating relevant texts via vector databases and injecting these into the LLM’s context.
