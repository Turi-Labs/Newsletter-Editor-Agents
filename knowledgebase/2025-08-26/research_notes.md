The “Human-like RAG – with no vectors” concept introduces an alternative approach to retrieval augmented generation by eliminating the need for vector databases and artificial chunking. Instead, it organizes documents into a hierarchical tree structure and uses a reasoning-based tree search to navigate through sections, much like a human would scan through a text by context and structure. This method replaces approximate semantic matching with explicit reasoning about information location, leading to a retrieval process that is transparent, structured, and explainable.

The approach’s key technical detail lies in its ability to mirror human reading behavior, thereby helping teams build trust in the outputs and simplify debugging workflows. It emphasizes that efficiency and human-like logic can be as transformative as scaling with vectors, suggesting that retrieval systems can achieve high performance without relying solely on brute-force vector comparisons. The discussion is further complemented by a reference to a related GitHub repository, highlighting practical implementation avenues.

In this update, NVIDIA demonstrated that training a large 12-billion parameter model on 10 trillion tokens is feasible using a new low-precision format called NVFP4. This method achieves the accuracy of 16-bit precision while benefiting from the speed and efficiency of 4-bit computations. The study involved a comparison with FP8—a format known in earlier research to closely match 16-bit precision—and showed that NVFP4 maintains stable convergence throughout training, without the instabilities typically associated with ultra-low precision techniques.

The experiments were performed on a 12B Hybrid Mamba-Transformer model using a phased data-blending approach, where the dataset mix was progressively modified at 70% and 90% of the training phases. Results indicated that NVFP4’s validation loss closely tracked that of the higher-precision FP8, confirming that aggressive bit-width reduction can be successfully applied to large-scale pretraining. This breakthrough could lead to significant improvements in computational efficiency and cost savings for deep learning initiatives.

Meta has announced a major $10B investment in rural Louisiana to build its largest data center, a project designed to eventually provide over 2 gigawatts—and potentially up to 5 gigawatts—of computing capacity earmarked for training open-source large language models. The selection of rural Louisiana is driven by factors such as access to abundant water supplies, cheap energy (aided by the region’s coal-heavy MISO grid and state incentives), and vast, contiguous land parcels, despite the area’s potential ecological and community impacts. In addition, while Meta has made non-binding promises to increase renewable energy usage, recent legislative changes in Louisiana even allow natural gas to count as green energy, raising concerns about long-term environmental implications.

The discussion around this development has also highlighted key technical details including the data center’s reliance on evaporative cooling (using 90% of consumed water) and the overall high power demands associated with hyperscale operations. Critics argue that these factors could strain local water and energy resources, echoing broader debates over industrial ecological costs—although some maintain that compared to traditional heavy industries, the environmental footprint remains manageable.

The announcement introduces Sideko, a hybrid code generator that leverages both deterministic code generation and LLM-based enhancements to create and maintain API client SDKs from OpenAPI specifications. Traditional generators, which use static templates, often overwrite custom modifications, resulting in brittle, machine-generated code that requires extensive manual rework. In contrast, Sideko employs structured pattern matching queries to analyze the existing codebase, allowing it to make incremental updates while preserving developer customizations—even when the API changes. This blend of deterministic approaches with LLM augmentation ensures that crucial human edits remain intact across regenerations.

Technically, Sideko's workflow begins with a deterministic code generation step that establishes the foundational SDK structure. Next, LLMs are used to enhance specific components where adaptability adds measurable value, supported by language-specific rules (notably for Python and TypeScript) and stringent testing methods including type-checking and integration tests against mock servers. This method significantly reduces the need for manual glue code maintenance and helps maintain a clean, high-quality codebase in dynamic environments. More details on this approach and its releases can be found at: https://github.com/Sideko-Inc/sideko/tree/main/releases/determinism-plus-llms
