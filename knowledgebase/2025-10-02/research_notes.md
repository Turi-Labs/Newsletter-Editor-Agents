AstroBee is an AI-powered tool designed to automatically generate semantic layers for business data. It connects data sources, storing information in either the user’s own data warehouse or one managed by AstroBee. The system scans and models the aggregated data to create an integrated, curated source of truth—which the team refers to as an “ontology” due to its Palantir-inspired structure. Users can interact with this unified data source by building applications or engaging directly via conversational interfaces to extract analytical insights. Additionally, if the initial semantic suggestions don’t meet expectations, users are free to provide their own context to define and hydrate their semantic layers.

Technically, AstroBee addresses challenges in data integration and complex data engineering by automating parts of the pipeline, such as handling joins, entity resolution, and normalization. Built on OpenAI’s API for business (with plans for alternatives in higher-security environments), the tool promises a modern data layer that could simplify the development of internal AI-powered applications. The early feedback indicates that it provides an efficient, self-serve means for hypothesis testing and data modeling without requiring deep data expertise.

Grapes Studio is an HTML-first web editor built on top of GrapesJS, incorporating an LLM assistant to combine the benefits of a visual no-code environment with direct HTML/CSS editing. The project, developed by the creator of GrapesJS alongside his team, takes a distinctive approach compared to full-fledged AI site builders that create complex React apps. Instead, it aims to simplify website creation by allowing users to drag and drop elements, let the LLM execute specific instructions such as “add a section” or “add a new page,” and even import existing sites for editing—all while relying on straightforward code rather than proprietary formats.

This hybrid model offers flexibility for both non-technical users and developers who may wish to tweak code directly when automated edits do not meet expectations. It addresses concerns such as build errors and overly complicated pages that have been common pitfalls with other AI-driven solutions, and it provides an alternative to platforms like WordPress, where costs and plugin limitations can be restrictive. By focusing on HTML/CSS for websites rather than full React applications, Grapes Studio (https://grapesjs.com/) promises a more accessible and efficient workflow, bridging the gap between visual editing and code-level customization.

Summary 11:
InsForge AI is an open-source project offering an agent-friendly alternative to Supabase, designed specifically to improve the developer experience by automating security defaults and reducing the need for manual configuration. The platform addresses key issues with current backend-as-a-service solutions—such as default Row-Level Security (RLS) which causes query failures without proper policies, verbose and error-prone policy writing, and the cumbersome manual wiring for secrets and authentication—by introducing Management Control Protocol (MCP) servers. These MCP servers automatically enforce secure and scalable defaults, enabling both agents and traditional developers to collaborate safely and efficiently on their projects.

Built primarily on Postgres and managed through AWS, InsForge AI provides both hosted and self-hosted options, ensuring that users can choose between a completely managed cloud experience and the flexibility of integrating their own Postgres instance. While the current focus is on Postgres, future support for other databases like MySQL or MongoDB is planned in response to user demand. By merging robust security, automated debugging, and advanced workflow management, InsForge AI aims to lower entry barriers for agentic applications and streamline production CI/CD workflows.

Summary 14:
A Dutch judge has ruled that Meta must respect its users’ choice regarding the recommendation system on its platforms. Specifically, the ruling mandates that Meta must allow users to maintain a non-personalized, chronological feed option, rather than defaulting permanently to its algorithmically ranked feed. To enforce this, the court imposed a penalty structure of €100,000 per day (or part thereof) for non-compliance, up to a maximum of €5 million, with the fine being forfeited to Bits of Freedom if Meta fails to adjust its practices.

This decision is significant as it challenges the prevailing ad-driven, algorithmic model that not only prioritizes targeted advertising but is also seen as contributing to social media addiction and data exploitation. The case underscores growing public and political attention to issues of privacy, user control, and content manipulation in social media, and may set a precedent for further regulatory intervention in the tech sector.
