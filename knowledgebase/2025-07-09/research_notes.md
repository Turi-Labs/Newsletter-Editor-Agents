The MCP-B protocol, announced via mcp-b.ai, introduces a new approach for AI browser automation that leverages a server-client architecture built directly into websites. Rather than relying on traditional methods such as DOM traversal or computer vision (as seen in frameworks like Playwright or Selenium), MCP-B offers deterministic JavaScript function calls through an embedded MCP server. This allows AI agents to interact with web pages by invoking specific functions (MCP tools) that expose controlled and secure actions, reducing the complexity typically involved in automating browser activities.

Technical discussions around MCP-B highlight its ability to offer a consistent and standardized interface across different tools and workflows, including integration with React-based frameworks and support for authenticated, multi-tenant environments. However, challenges remain, particularly with web authentication and the safe delegation of permissions in multi-user scenarios. The protocol’s focus on limiting the potential damage an AI can cause—by confining it to user-scoped client-side APIs—opens up possibilities for both website owners and developers to enhance automation while managing security risks.

Summary 6:
The content introduces a new tool that augments LLM agents with visual capabilities—such as OCR, object detection, and video editing—through simple English prompts. This innovative approach eliminates the need for custom computer vision code and brittle CV pipelines by enabling users to describe their desired operations (e.g., “Blur all faces in this image and preview it” or “Trim this video from 0:30 to 1:10 and add captions”) directly to the agent. The tool works across any MCP-compatible agent like Claude, OpenAI, Cursor, etc., transforming natural language instructions into complex visual AI workflows.

The approach notably utilizes a dynamic, tool-calling method rather than relying on a single end-to-end vision model. When the core Visual Language Models (VLMs) encounter tasks they cannot perform directly, they intelligently delegate to specialized modules (OCR, detection, segmentation) to process intermediate results—even if those results are image outputs themselves. This method not only bridges current gaps in visual understanding but also emphasizes the system’s potential for integration with various agentic frameworks. Users and developers are encouraged to try out the demo and provide feedback.

The announcement details the introduction of CacheBlend, a core component of the LMCache project, designed to significantly enhance RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) applications by reusing non-prefix KV caches. Traditional KV caching only supports a common prefix, which limits the reuse of earlier computations when new context is dynamically inserted at non-initial positions. CacheBlend overcomes this limitation by intelligently managing positional encoding updates and selectively recalculating the minimal required cross-attention, ensuring a 100% KV Cache hit rate with almost lossless output quality.

This innovative solution not only speeds up the time-to-first-token (TTFT) but also increases throughput, potentially allowing around a 3X speed increase, which is especially beneficial for modern LLM applications like RAG and Agents. The technique has already received recognition through a Best Paper Award at ACM EuroSys 2025, underscoring its technical significance and practical impact. For a detailed demonstration and more technical insights, please refer to: https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache-Examples/blob/main/demo-rag-blending/README.md.
