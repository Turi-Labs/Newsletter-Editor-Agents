Summary 18:
The paper “Expected Attention: KV Cache Compression by Estimating Attention” discusses a novel method for optimizing transformer models by compressing the key-value (KV) cache through estimated attention. Instead of merely speeding up inference and reducing memory usage, the approach directly tackles the attenuation dilution problem seen with longer context windows. Initial evaluations were performed on 4K and 16K context windows, where even at small compression ratios the method outperformed baseline models with no compression, indicating potential benefits beyond traditional efficiency improvements.

The work opens the possibility of further refinement, such as merging similar cache items rather than simply dropping those deemed unlikely to contribute. One suggestion noted in the discussion refers to techniques that combine neighboring tokens based on past attention scores, which could be enhanced by utilizing expected future attention. The full details and methodology can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00636.

Summary 26:
OpenAI and AMD have announced a significant computing deal that marks a new phase in the AI boom. Under the agreement, OpenAI will purchase massive quantities of AMD chips, a move designed to boost AMD’s revenue and stock performance. OpenAI currently holds warrants tied to AMD’s stock, meaning that as AMD’s stock price rises, these warrants increase in value, providing OpenAI with a growing incentive to continue purchasing and deploying AMD hardware.

The deal establishes a circular incentive chain: increased orders drive up AMD’s stock price, which in turn enhances the value of OpenAI’s warrants, thereby motivating further chip orders. However, this chain carries risks—if any link weakens, such as underperformance of the chips, a cooling market, or overextension by OpenAI, the growth momentum could reverse, ultimately impacting both companies negatively.
