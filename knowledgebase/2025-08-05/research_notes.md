Anthropic has announced that paid API credits will expire one year after issuance, with a notification sent to organizations stating the exact expiration date. To mitigate service disruption, Anthropic recommends enabling an auto-reload feature in the console so that credits are automatically replenished when the balance falls below a set limit. This policy change is rooted in accounting principles, as expiring credits helps avoid indefinitely held deferred revenue liabilities, which in turn simplifies revenue recognition and reduces the financial complications associated with holding someone else’s money.

The discussion around this policy highlights concerns among users over potential loss of credit value and comparisons with other industries, such as gift cards and in-game currencies, which sometimes continue to hold funds indefinitely. Various commenters debated the legal and practical implications of expiring credits—citing cash flow, revenue recognition timing, and state-specific consumer protection laws—while noting that similar practices are common among cloud service providers. The significance of this decision lies in balancing business accounting needs (preventing a growing liability on the balance sheet) with consumer expectations and fairness in service delivery.
