The Reuters report outlines that an Italian watchdog has ordered Meta to stop enforcing a WhatsApp policy clause that bars the integration of rival AI chatbots. Italian regulators are scrutinizing this provision because it restricts competition in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, which could hinder the development and deployment of innovative AI solutions by other companies.

This decision is significant as it reflects growing regulatory efforts across Europe to ensure that dominant technology firms do not use restrictive contractual terms to stifle competition. If Meta does not amend the terms promptly, further intervention or penalties may follow.
